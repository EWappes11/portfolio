  aboutMe:
    "Currently, I am gaining valuable experience in manufacturing as an Operations KDP at Kautex Textron. My goal is to transition into automation, controls, and robotics engineering, where I can leverage my skill in PLC's, embedded programing, and passion for technology. My background includes significant experience in the Automotive and Power Sports industries. As a Manufacturing Engineering Intern at Kautex Textron, I worked on helium leak testing and developed digital work instructions. More recently, I served as an Electrical Engineering Intern with Arctic Cat and Textron Specialized Vehicles, focusing on researching and testing new battery technologies. In addition to my technical experience, I have demonstrated leadership as the Vice President of the Indiana Theta chapter of Phi Delta Theta Fraternity, where I was honored with the Neil A. Armstrong First Man Award. I am also a graduate of the Shaffer Honors College of Leadership. Outside of work, I am passionate about automation, vintage trucks, woodworking, and spending time outdoors. I am always eager to connect with professionals in my field and expand my network.",
